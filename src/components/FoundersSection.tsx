    story: "From a young engineering student with big dreams to the founder of Festiva Foundation, Rohith's journey has been driven by a simple yet powerful belief: that every individual has the potential to create meaningful change. After witnessing the gap between privilege and need in society, he realized that sustainable impact requires more than good intentionsâ€”it needs structured action, community collaboration, and unwavering commitment to service. Today, through Festiva Foundation, he's building a platform where passion meets purpose, creating lasting change one volunteer at a time."
